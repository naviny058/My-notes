# Python Indentation
    # Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

# Python has no command for declaring a variable.
    # A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
    # Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
# name = 'navin'
# print(name)
# name = 23
# print(name)
    # casting If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
# name = str(5)
# print(type(name))
# print(name)
# name = 3
# print(type(name))
# print(name)


# Many Values to Multiple Variables
# name1, name2, name3 = 'vikas', 'saroj', 'ashish'
# print(name1)
# print(name2)
# print(name3)
